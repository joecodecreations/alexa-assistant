# Alexa Assistant
This is a sample application for Alexa coded using nodejs. This repository is a **WIP** but it will get you up and running.

## Automated Setup Also Available:
* [Alexa Automated Setup](https://github.com/joecodecreations/alexa-automation-setup)
This will bring in the [Alexa Server Setup](https://github.com/joecodecreations/alexa-server) automatically, and then bring in the sample app found in this repo to get you up and running quickly.

## Update package.json with applicationId
After you have signed up with an Amazon developer account, and started to create your skill, you will be given an applicationId.
To include this, update it on row `9` of the `package.json`

...more documentation coming soon.
