This is a sample application for Alexa coded using nodejs. This repository is a **WIP** but it will get you up and running.

## Automated Setup Also Available:

This will bring in the [Alexa Server Setup](https://github.com/joecodecreations/alexa-server) automatically, and then bring in the sample app found in this repo to get you up and running quickly.
